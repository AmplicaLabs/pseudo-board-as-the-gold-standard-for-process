# pseudo-board-as-the-gold-standard-for-process

⚠️ _Disclaimer this is meant to be a standard, but feel free to use and season to taste for your team needs_.⚠️ 

As we start to all migrate to using a single tool for work tracking on teh Eng teams at Labs (_Pivotal Tracker is going away and Zenhub is only for OS repos_) we wanted to crate a pseudo work tracking board and make it the gold-standard as we all migrate to GH projects.  If you have questions or want a walk thru ping Patrick
